- Hi, I’m @davidcreacy
- I’m looking to improve my skills towards software developement
- I’m currently learning C++ and i have spent time on Python., but only as far as how to read the language. i do not know how to actually begin writing real code.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any project in order to learn. i will most likely take a hands off aproach in the beginning for fear of screwing up royally.
-
- if i have not changed this page in a while please ignore. i may have gotten better since then.
- it is 11-1-2023
